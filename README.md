# CC-Soundboard
Le funny sounds for computercraft

## How to install
rn you can only download it directly with this command SPECIFICALLY ON AN **Advanced Noisy Pocket Computer**:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KylomaskGamer/CC-Soundboard/main/soundboard.lua soundboard.lua
```

and just run it with this
```
soundboard
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you see an alert whoch says speaker not connected THIS IS NOT A BUG KN THE CODE (if you run `peripherals` and see None it shows its not my problem) just leave and rejoin or restart your mc if it didnt work

(It was built and tested on a pocket computer, you may use this on somewhere else but ita not recommended i dont get why youd use this on them)
###### (well UNLESS you can make a 26x20 terminal size then itll work. if someone could make a pull request for this itll be greatly appreciated)
